# Bus Attendance System with QR Code Scanning (Java Spring Boot)

This Java Spring Boot project is designed to automate the process of taking attendance on a bus using QR code scanning technology. The system leverages Spring Boot for easy development, Spring Data JPA for efficient data management, and a PostgreSQL database for storing attendance records. The project is organized as a Maven project for easy dependency management and build configuration.

## Features

- QR code scanning: Passengers can use their unique QR codes for quick and convenient check-in.
- Time constraint: Attendance is recorded within a specified time window, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
- Automated recording: The system automatically logs the attendance of each passenger in the PostgreSQL database.
- Spring Boot: Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for streamlined development.
- Spring Data JPA: Provides a convenient way to interact with the database and manage attendance records.
- Maven: Organized as a Maven project for easy dependency management and build configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bus-attendance-spring.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd bus-attendance-spring
```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `application.properties` file with the appropriate database configuration:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bus_attendance_db
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password
```

4. Build the project:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

5. Run the Spring Boot application:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

1. Ensure the Spring Boot application is running.

2. Passengers should present their QR codes to the scanner within the specified time window.

3. The system will automatically record the attendance of each passenger in the PostgreSQL database.

## Configuration

The project's behavior can be customized through the `application.properties` file. This file allows you to configure database settings, time constraints, and other Spring Boot-related properties.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following technologies and libraries:

- Java Spring Boot: Provides the framework for building Spring applications.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions.
- PostgreSQL: Used as the database for storing attendance records.
- Maven: Used for project organization and dependency management.
